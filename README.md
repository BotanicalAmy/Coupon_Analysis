# Coupon_Analysis
Coupon Analysis project for a machine learning and AI certification course

The attached Jupyter Notebook includes an analysis of Amazon coupon data.  The collected survey data comes from the results of drivers in the area where the custom coupons were sent via automated phone messages.

My findings show that restaurants with a value of under $20 have a higher coupon acceptance rate.  Additionally, those without child passengers and those who frequent bars are 17% more likely to accept the coupon.  The data could be investigated further by manipulating some ranges to create an integer value to allow for correlation matrix analysis.

The coupon distribution is much more prevalent among those who are unemployed.  More experimental details must be gathered to understand the cause of the occupation disparity.
